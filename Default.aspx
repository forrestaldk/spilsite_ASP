            <strong>New "Rising" version of MMORPG to be available without subscription fee next month with no level cap or content restrictions for new players.</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            En Masse Entertainment's massively multiplayer online role-playing game Tera will be free-to-play when it relaunches at Tera: Rising February 5, it was announced today. Previously, the free-to-play switch was scheduled to take place sometime in February. The new version of the game will not require a subscription fee and new players will not face any content restrictions or a level cap.
				<br>
            <br>
            Though Tera: Rising will be available to play for free, players can use real-world money to purchase various items on an a la carte basis from the in-game marketplace.
				<br>
            <br>
            Past and current Tera subscribers will be awarded permanent "founder" status, which carries numerous exclusive privileges. Those who pay $15 per month for "Elite" status will be granted extra dungeon rewards, 10 bonus quests per day, a daily delivery of items and boosts, an elite mount, in-game store discounts, and waived brokerage registration taxes.
				<br>
            <br>
            A detailed breakdown of Free-versus-Founder-versus-Elite status benefits can be found at the official Tera website.
				<br>
            <br>
            To coincide with the free-to-play business model switch for Tera, new in-game content will be made available. This includes a wave-based dungeon called the Crucible of Flame and a PvP battleground map called Champions' Skyring that "introduces a new way for players to test their skills against each other."
				<br>
            <br>
            Tera is the latest MMO to drop its subscription fee, following Lord of the Rings Online, Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures, EverQuest II, Aion, and Star Wars: The Old Republic. Bethesda has not said if its upcoming MMO The Elder Scrolls Online will carry a subscription fee, though consultant Nicholas Lovell believes the game will launch with a subscription before going free-to-play.

            <br>
            TERA is actually amazing
						<br>
            <br>
            i never played it before and installed it couple days ago
						<br>
            <br>
            and holy shit was i missing out , this game blows guild wars 2 combat system away , the combat is amazing i lvled my warrior to 25 and the battles i had with basilisks and naga mercenaries were the most fun i had in a LONG TIME
						<br>
            <br>
            this game is worth playing , questing system is simple and u have the objectives nicely displayed on your map , no more searching for some quest items on the web its all there
						<br>
            <br>
            the questing is all about killing stuff , and its fine because its the most fun part of the game anyway
						<br>
            <br>
            also the open word pvp is great i havent seen this type of pvp since wow vanilla days or diablo2 , going hostile on questing ppl or just camping bridges with a friend or two is common thing to see (and actually very easy to avoid too u just switch the district if u dont want to fight , but than again why did u roll on pvp server in the 1st place if u dont expect to be ganked etc :) )
						<br>
            <br>
            anyway this game is awesome and totally worth trying , i might just throw some money at them if they do the free to play model right - and it looks like they are doing it right (not limiting pvp for free to play users and boosting pve refresh rate for premiums)
						<br>
            <br>
            just my 2 cents
						<br>
